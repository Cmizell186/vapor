  - Create a Game.
  In creating a pixel perfect clone, we had to use creative liberties when listing a game on our store. Steam's developer service/storefront is not accessible to
  regular users. Jason Vien, our most talented developer, created a page that borders on perfection. You have several options for listing your game, including a 
  video link.
