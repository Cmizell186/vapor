From my days of DW3XL on my PS2 to now DW8XLCE on my PC it always puts a smile on my face and helps me forget about everything. I can appreciate the story now that I'm older too (watching Three Kingdoms the TV show to enjoy the drama). It's already 3 times as much content as DW7 (Story alone). Hypotheticals and What-ifs take quite a few tries unless you look it up (and even then). You're getting at least 1 hour per dollar here. DLCs are all extra and not needed but once I finish the story I'll be throwing down for costumes (because they're not usable in Story anyway). We'll see how many hours I have left for Jin and Other.

If you are willing to put up with the glitches (which include essentially nonfunctional titan physics in the last few levels) then you will enjoy the game quite a bit especially with how much extra content it has. that being said, there is very little game play outside of 'find titan, kill titan, set up base, protect citizen/MP troops.
